This folder contains all the code requied to fit a model.  Model outputs are
placed in each of the version folders v0 - v5 depending on which random effects
are being fit.


# v0

Random effects: None

This model was pos def Hessian.


# v1

Random effects: b

Not done


# v2

Random effects: b, z

This model has been fitted with a weekly time-step and strong convergence
criteria. Not pdH. Fits look a little too good to be true.


# v3

Random effects: b, z, y

Not done.


# v4

Random effects: b, z, x

This model did work.


# v5

Random effects: b, z, y, x

Not done.
