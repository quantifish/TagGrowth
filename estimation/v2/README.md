This model has been fitted with a weekly time-step and strong convergence
criteria. Not pdH. Fits look a little too good to be true.

Wow, I had a bit of an issue runnig this, it crashed my computer. I also had a
clash between STAN and TMB. Need to look into this further. Will try to
uninstall STAN. Have reinstalled TMB.
