# Case Study - Antarctic toothfish

This folder contains all the code requied to fit a model.  Model outputs are
placed in each of the version folders depending on which random-effects are
being fitted. The models run, if they were pdH and the folders they are stored
in is summarised in the table below.

| Random effects | pdH | Folder |
